// find & correct all identifier naming errors, explaining which
// rules have been violated for each

int 1value = 10;      -----> fixed version: int value1 = 10;
float avg-rate = 12.5; ----> fixed version: float avg_rate = 12.5;
char Class = 'A'; ---------> fixed version: char _Class = 'A'

As defined in Lecture 16, Slide 9, Naming Rules for Identifiers are as follows:
- Must begin with either a letter or underscore
- Must only consist of letters, digits, and undercores
- Must NOT be a C reserved word
- Case Sensitive
- Only first 31 chars are significant

the first identifier's (int 1value) naming error is that it begins with a number, which
is not allowed as it goes against the rule that an identifier must start with either a letter
or underscore, NOT a number. I would fix this issue by moving the 1 to the end of the identifier.

the second identifier's (float avg-rate) naming error is that it includes a dash, which does not
follow the restrictions of only consisting of letters, digits, and underscored. I would fix this issue by
replacing the dash with an underscore instead.

the third and final identifier's (Class) naming error is that it utilizes a reserved keyword, that of
which is Class. I would fix this issue by inserting an underscore infront of the word Class so that
it is not recognized as a reserved keyword.
