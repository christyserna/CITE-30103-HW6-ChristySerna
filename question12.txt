// a developer expected res = 11 but got something else. Explain & fix this code.

int a = 5, b = 3, res;        //original code
res = a + b << 1;

/* since the original code has the bitwise left shift symbol, I believe the reason why
they didn't get their desired output of 11 is because of improper syntax / operation precedence
rules.

int a = 5, b = 3, res;
res = (a + b) << 1;
