//explain step-by-step how a c program moves from source code to execution,
// listing the stages & at least one possible error at each stage

/* In order for a C program to move from the given source code to the execution stage, it has to go
through the preprocessing stage, compilation stage, assembly stage, linking stage, and finally,
the loading stage.

  Preprocessing Stage: The stage in which the preprocessor program processes the code.
  Possible Error: Syntax errors from the code may cause the code to either be processed incorrectly
  or not processed at all.

  Compilation Stage: The stage in which the compiler translates the source code into assembly language.
  Possible Error: Syntax errors, even ones as small as forgetting a bracket or misspelling a variable
  can cause the source code to be mistranslated into assembly language.

  Assembly Stage: The stage in which the assembler converts the assembly language into object code.
  Possible Error: Performance errors may occur at this stage if code is not concise or optimal
  can result in the improper conversion of the object code

  Linking Stage: The stage in which the linker links the object code with the libraries,
  creating an executable file.
  Possible Error: If you get to the linking stage, you can still run into issues such as having
  incorrectly linked libraries.

  Loading Stage: The stage in which the loader puts program in memory.
  Possible Error: If memory was not allocated efficiently, you can even run into errors in the loading
  stage, which in this case, would cause the loading stage to fail.
