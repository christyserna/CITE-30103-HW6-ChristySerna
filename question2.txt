//explain step-by-step how a c program moves from source code to execution,
// listing the stages & at least one possible error at each stage

/* In order for a C program to move from the given source code to the execution stage, it has to go
through the preprocessing stage, compilation stage, assembly stage, linking stage, and finally,
the loading stage.

  Preprocessing Stage: The stage in which the preprocessor program processes the code.
  Possible Error: 

  Compilation Stage: The stage in which the compiler translates the source code into assembly language.
  Possible Error: 

  Assembly Stage: The stage in which the assembler converts the assembly language into object code.
  Possible Error:

  Linking Stage: The stage in which the linker links the object code with the libraries,
creating an executable file.
  Possible Error:

  Loading Stage: The stage in which the loader puts program in memory.
  Possible Error:
