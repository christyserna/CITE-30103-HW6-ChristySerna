//what happens if #include <stdio.h> is removed from a program that calls for printf?
//identify the stage that will fail & describe the error message you might expect

/* Because the #include <stdio.h> is a part of the link section which instructs the compiler
to link functions from the system library to the program it is being utilized in, the printf()
function will not be properly recognized by the program as it has no system library to get said
information from. (hopefully i explained that well). In this case, the stage that would fail would
be the preprocessing & compiling code, as the preprocessing code will not entirely understand
what is meant by printf(), leading to the creating of the object code in the compiling stage
to be incorrect / not produce the desired results. If this happens, you can expect to get an error
message regarding the fact that the printf function was not declared */
